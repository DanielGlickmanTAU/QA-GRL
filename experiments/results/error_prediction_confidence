question:is the new god of war 2 players
text:The gameplay is vastly different from the previous installments, as it was rebuilt from the ground up. Although the previous main installment, Ascension (2013), introduced multiplayer to the series, this installment is single-player-only. The game features a third-person, over-the-shoulder free camera, a departure from the previous installments, which featured a third-person, fixed cinematic camera (with the exception of 2007|'s 2D side-scroller Betrayal). Cinematographically, the game is presented in a continuous shot, with no camera cuts. The game is open, but it is not open-world. Due to it being open, players can fast travel to different locations. As the ability to swim was cut from the game, players instead use a boat to traverse bodies of water. Just like previous entries, there are puzzles for players to solve to progress through parts of the game. Enemies in the game stem from Norse mythology, such as variants of trolls, ogres, dark elves and their king, wolves, wulvers, nightmares, draugrs, tatzelwurms, as well as Gullveig and the revenants, beings warped by seiðr magic, among other original creatures. Valkyries appear as optional boss battles, and players can free the dragons Fáfnir, Otr, and Reginn--dwarfs that were turned into dragons--in addition to battling a dragon called Hræzlyr.

question:does the dealer have to hit on 16
text:Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer|'s turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received Blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total 17 or more points. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a ``soft|'|' 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or not busting and having the dealer bust, or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have the same total (not counting blackjacks), this is called a ``push|'|', and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand. Otherwise, the dealer wins.

question:is the sort code the same for everyone
text:The following list shows the first two digits of the sort codes allocated to clearing banks. Thus, in the example 01-10-01, 01 indicates that the bank is a branch of the National Westminster Bank; the other sets of digits are for internal use. This example represents the NatWest branch in Spring Gardens, Manchester. Clearing banks can act for other banks, so looking up a bank by sort code in this list does not always mean the account is actually handled by that bank, e.g. the sort code 08-32-00 HMRC VAT is not a Co-operative Bank account but a Barclays account, as is 08-32-10 for National Insurance.

Along with the related EAN barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items at the point of sale, per GS1 specifications. UPC data structures are a component of GTINs and follow the global GS1 specification, which is based on international standards. But some retailers (clothing, furniture) do not use the GS1 system (rather other barcode symbologies or article number systems). On the other hand, some retailers use the EAN/UPC barcode symbology, but without using a GTIN (for products sold in their own stores only).

question:does the statute of limitations apply to all crimes
text:Crimes considered heinous by society have no statute of limitations. Although there is usually no statute of limitations for murder (particularly first-degree murder), judges have been known to dismiss murder charges in cold cases if they feel the delay violates the defendant|'s right to a speedy trial. For example, waiting many years for an alibi witness to die before commencing a murder trial would be unconstitutional. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court in Stogner v. California ruled that the retroactive extension of the statute of limitations for sexual offenses committed against minors was an unconstitutional ex post facto law.

text:The Emancipation Proclamation has been ridiculed, notably in an influential passage by Richard Hofstadter for ``freeing|'|' only the slaves over which the Union had no power. These slaves were freed due to Lincoln|'s ``war powers|'|'. This act cleared up the issue of contraband slaves. It automatically clarified the status of over 100,000 now-former slaves. Some 20,000 to 50,000 slaves were freed the day it went into effect in parts of nine of the ten states to which it applied (Texas being the exception). In every Confederate state (except Tennessee and Texas), the Proclamation went into immediate effect in Union-occupied areas and at least 20,000 slaves were freed at once on January 1, 1863.

question:is static pressure the same as atmospheric pressure
text:When selecting the position for the static port, the aircraft designer|'s objective is to ensure the pressure in the aircraft|'s static pressure system is as close as possible to the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying, across the operating range of weight and airspeed. Many authors describe the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying as the freestream static pressure. At least one author takes a different approach in order to avoid a need for the expression freestream static pressure. Gracey has written ``The static pressure is the atmospheric pressure at the flight level of the aircraft|'|'. Gracey then refers to the air pressure at any point close to the aircraft as the local static pressure.

question:is the hunchback of notre dame real story
text:Victor Hugo began writing Notre-Dame de Paris in 1829, largely to make his contemporaries more aware of the value of the Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. For instance, the medieval stained glass panels of Notre-Dame de Paris had been replaced by white glass to let more light into the church. This explains the large descriptive sections of the book, which far exceed the requirements of the story. A few years earlier, Hugo had already published a paper entitled Guerre aux Démolisseurs (War to the Demolishers) specifically aimed at saving Paris|' medieval architecture. The agreement with his original publisher, Gosselin, was that the book would be finished that same year, but Hugo was constantly delayed due to the demands of other projects. In the summer of 1830, Gosselin demanded that Hugo complete the book by February 1831. Beginning in September 1830, Hugo worked nonstop on the project thereafter. The book was finished six months later.

text:An inert gas/noble gas is a gas which does not undergo chemical reactions under a set of given conditions. The noble gases often do not react with many substances, and were historically referred to as the inert gases. Inert gases are used generally to avoid unwanted chemical reactions degrading a sample. These undesirable chemical reactions are often oxidation and hydrolysis reactions with the oxygen and moisture in air. The term inert gas is context-dependent because several of the noble gases can be made to react under certain conditions.

Unwanted natural gas was a disposal problem in the active oil fields. If there was not a market for natural gas near the wellhead it was prohibitively expensive to pipe to the end user.

question:did all of the lava flows associated with mauna loa originate at the top of the volcano
text:Following a 1949 event, the next major eruption at Mauna Loa occurred in 1950. Originating from the volcano|'s southwestern rift zone, the eruption remains the largest rift event in the volcano|'s modern history, lasting 23 days, emitting 376 million cubic meters of lava, and reaching 24 km (15 mi) the ocean within 3 hours. The 1950 eruption was not the most voluminous eruption on the volcano (the long-lived 1872--1877 event produced more than twice as much material), but it was easily one of the fastest-acting, producing the same amount of lava as the 1859 eruption in a tenth of the time. Flows overtook the village of Hoʻokena-mauka in South Kona, crossed Hawaii Route 11, and reached the sea within four hours of eruption. Although there was no loss of life, the village was permanently destroyed. After the 1950 event, Mauna Loa, entered an extended period of dormancy, interrupted only by a small single-day summit event in 1975. However, it rumbled to life again in 1984, manifesting first at Mauna Loa|'s summit, and then producing a narrow, channelized |'a|'a flow that advanced downslope within 6 km (4 mi) of Hilo, close enough to illuminate the city at nighttime. However, the flow got no closer, as two natural levees further up its pathway consequently broke and diverted active flows.

question:do all craftsman tools have a lifetime warranty
text:Most Craftsman hand tools are advertised as having an unlimited lifetime warranty. This lifetime warranty program was instituted by Sears when they began selling the Craftsman line in 1927. This warranty program requires no receipt or dated proof of purchase. If the owner takes the item into a local retail store, it may be replaced or repaired free of charge. In some cases, such as ratchets, the customer may be offered a repair kit with which to repair the item or an already refurbished item. As of 2017, many Sears stores do not offer the kits to consumers, instead they will either rebuild the customer|'s ratchet or provide one that they have already rebuilt. Ratchet kits for the US made ratchets are different than those for the Asian made ratchets, although some repair kits for the US made ratchets are now made in China (but again, will not interchange with the kits for the Asian ratchets). As of 2018, some stores will supply the customer the rebuild kits for them to rebuild on their own, others will require the customer to have the store employees rebuild the ratchet for them.
