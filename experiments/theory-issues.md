###did not seem to learn to learn on Race dataset 
the classfier acurraccy got stuck on 0.75(always answer false). Even thought the same code did
work for SWAG dataset. 
I tried overfitting on a small dataset(100 examples) for 20 epochs, but it still did not work.
In the end it turned out it did learn, just not as easily as with swag.
I tried a tiny tiny dataset(5 examples) for 100 epochs, and saw it did overfit.
